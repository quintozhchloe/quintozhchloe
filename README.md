- ⚡ Fun fact:
-  🚀Why I choose this career: 
   When I was in primary school, my aunt gave me a computer. and that’s when I had my first encounter with JavaScript.
   Back then, a popular social media in my country called Tencent QQ allowed everyone to have their own personal blog.
   I was curious about how to improve the appearance of my blog and discovered JavaScript plugins. That’s when I realized
   how fascinating IT could be. Although my bachelor's studies weren't in a technology-related field, I was deeply passionate
   about IT and taught myself the skills I needed. After gaining some experience, I decided to pursue a Master of
   Information Technology at University Of Auckland to deepen my knowledge and career prospects. This journey led me to New Zealand
   and solidified my decision to pursue a career in this industry.
   
-  🐱‍🏍What makes you different from others：
   I think what sets me apart is my ability to take initiative and get things done. For example, this semester, I had a team
    project for one of my courses, and I didn’t know anyone in the group. When we started our first assignment, everyone was
   a bit hesitant, and it was clear that things weren’t progressing. I realized I needed to step up, so I took the initiative
   to create a group chat and scheduled regular meetings to keep us on track. I also made sure to actively share my ideas based
   on everyone’s assigned parts. We just finished our first project and got a pretty good grade, which I think really shows
   how important it is to take charge and communicate well.

-  😎How will you bring this to a role?
   I think I can bring the same kind of energy and teamwork to this role. Just like in my group project, I know when to step up
   and get things moving. I’m good at communicating and making sure everyone’s on the same page, which helps keep things on track.
   By staying organized and being proactive, I can help the team work together and hit our goals. I’m confident that I can use these
   skills to make a positive impact in this role.
   
-  🐱‍🐉Apart from work and studying things I love
   I spend about 15 minutes in the sun every day. The sunlight gives me positive energy to start my day. I really enjoy nature – it’s amazing! 
   And I love animals – they’re so cute! I used to be someone who didn’t like going outside, but since coming here, I’ve reconnected with nature 
   and gained so much energy from it. Besides that, I enjoy mindfulness meditation and I’m also learning to play the drums! If you’re interested 
   in these things, we can chat and explore the world together!
